# About this project
This project representes a small game store "RedSwanStore", where users can browse the list of all games in the store, view some info, screenshots, system requirements for any particular game and buy games (add them to user's library). Users can create new account and edit it anytime. The administrator can add new games, edit existing ones and delete games. 

Also in this project authorization by roles is implemented, with specific access for each role.
